task 2: Pics are diffrent, but the look is almost the same like the example in the homework.
task 3: Member's logo and button are different because I coudn't manage to found the same in internet,
	but they are with transperent background. There isn't the whole text in the article tag, because there is no point in
	re-write the whole one. Just focus on the formating. The link is with implemented hover functionality, despite it is 
	not required.
